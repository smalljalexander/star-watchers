# Howâ€™s it made
<b>Tech Used:</b> html, css, JavaScript 

I used flexbox for the styling of the page and made it responsive on any screen size.  I used JavaScript to fetch data from the nasa api with using a click event on the date button to start the fetch function. 

# Lessons learned
I learned how to look at documentation from the api to know how to manipulate the api to display the data I wanted.
